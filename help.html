                    <h4 class="text-right">BETWEEN BLACK AND WHITE</h4>
                    <p>
                        Mentors are integral to Udayan Care Shalini Fellowship. It is with the continuous efforts of the mentors that our Shalinis evolve and grow wings. They are teachers and guides, striving to lead Shalinis to the path to success.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That path is not always so black and white. This was the case for one of our Kolkata Shalinis. Hailing from a remote village in Bengal, she was a brilliant and talented girl and under the mentorship of Mr. Parimal Chandra Das, she flourished. However trouble came when, through the guidance of Das and her own inherent intellect, she got selected for IIT Kanpur. What should have been a source of great jubilation instead brought forth immense turmoil. Her parents, lacking exposure to geographical knowledge, thought Kanpur to be a foreign land and hence refused to send their daughter there. Das tried to help. He spoke to the parents again and again, but all of his counselling and discussing failed to yield any result, and his Shalini too was reluctant to go against them. Eventually this girl got admitted to the Department of Mathematics at Jadavpur University for pursuing her M Sc. Closer to home, this was a more acceptable option.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But this is not the end of the story. Destiny had other plans. After passing out from Jadavpur University, she again got accepted to an IIT! She was accepted by IIT Kharagpura, this time to pursue a PhD in Mathematics. Her college years had by then broadened her views and broadened those of her parents as well. This time she had no confusion and no turmoil, only the resolution to embrace this second chance. Without hesitation, she enrolled at IIT Kharagpura. Now, she is all set for a bright future, a future with her family’s support and confidence in herself.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Das’ intuitive understanding of her situation, and resulting decision not to force this Shalini to join IIT Kanpur, was key to this Shalini’s success. Had Das done otherwise, this young woman would have been alienated from her family and roots. So far from home in Kanpur, this could have been detrimental for her mental-physical health as she struggled to gain ground in a strange place surrounded by strange people. It was Das’ good judgement that has helped the girl grow slowly but nonetheless steadily until she could take true flight.

                    <div>
                        <p>
                            The joy was palpable as all dug into their McVeggie burgers and quenched the thirst with ice-cold Cokes and Sprites. This was a party. A treat from<a href="http://udayancare.org/Big-Friend-Little-Friend-Programme.html"> Big Friends to
					Little Friends</a>, a celebration of achieving the remarkable. They did it. They ALL did it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Every Little Friend cleared their XIII and IX exams with flying colors!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This was due to the efforts of three Big Friends: Aakriti, Sachin and Gohita.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Little Friends were struggling the most in Math, Science and English. Try as they might, they could not understand these subjects! Seeing the seriousness of the problem, last May Aakriti, Sachin and Gohita took the initiative to tutor the CLass XIII and IX Little Friends.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            All three devoted two hours a day, three days a week, to tutoring and divided the timings between themselves. The ultimate target was to prepare the Little Friends for their main exams which were scheduled to happen in February 2016. The Little Friends loved the classes, and eventually some of them liked the teaching style of the Big Friends so much that after a few months they left their private tuitions altogether, opting to totally rely on their Big Friends. This was trust, pure and simple. This was trust that came from seeing the Big Friends’ commitment and seeing that they truly cared. The students knew that Aakriti, Sachin and Gohita would give their all and lead them to score good marks.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And they were right.

                    <h4>WAITING FOR THE DAY</h4>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            Our children have a lot of mentors in their lives from caregivers to mentor parents. However, often some of the most influential mentors are the extraordinary people who volunteer their time and skills for the benefit of our children.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Riti is one such mentor. She has been working with 11-year old Anjali* since last September, coming every Saturday and Sunday, 2 hours a day. Observing Anjali’s difficulty with English, Riti decided to put all her efforts toward improving her language skills. So she read books with Anjali, had Anjali listen to her childhood cassette recording of Dr. Zuess, constantly pushing Anjali to increase her understanding of the stories. Through this, slowly but surely Riti has led Anjali to learn how to understand the words she reads, to truly grasp and enjoy the stories. Moreover, Riti has Anjali practice her English writing by regularly giving her an hour to write whatever she wishes: whatever stories, feelings, etc. are in her head. The quantity of the writing does not matter, only that she writes for this period.Through this, not only has Riti improved her English, but she has also kindled Anjali’s creativity and even given her a space to voice to her own trauma as she chooses.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This is not work done overnight. This is the slow work of months, the work of commitment against all challenge, the work of love. Teaching is not new to Riti—a college student now, she has been teaching children since her school days in Class XIII. But this was new, this was different—this was a challenge. And that is the best part for Riti. “She challenges me to go beyond conventional ways of teaching,” Riti told us, stressing how Anjali has pushed her to see from the child’s perspective and has opened Riti up to new understandings. Riti’s work is not complete yet, though. “I am waiting for the day when she corrects my English. This is what I am waiting for.”
